# ROOT Tutorial

The [root-cern](https://root.cern.ch/) is a data analysis framework written in **C++** and developed in **CERN**.
This repository contains codes and slides for ROOT tutorial. The problem with ROOT is that it is very hard to learn. First, you need to know concepts such as **Object Oriented Programming (OOP)** and a lot of **C++** syntax and concepts. Second, even if you know the **C++**, still learning root is not easy. The documentations are not good and sometimes you could not grasp what are the most core concepts that you need to know and omit details.


In this tutorial, I try to teach ROOT for begginers with a minimal knowledge of **C++**. In a video series at [Telegram](https://t.me/rootcern) I teach and explain [these codes]("./ROOT_TUTORIAL"). Unfortunately these videos are recoreded in Persian, but I hope in future, I will record english version.

Moreover, I have written some example codes of **PyROOT** in this repo. The **PyROOT** is a **Python** library of **C++** libraries of **ROOT**.
